            <p>My name is Nilsen Reyes and this is my first attempt at creating a full page about me.
                <br>
                <br>
                I am originally from Long Island, New York and come from a big, loving family. I am fluent in Spanish not only due to my family's background but also because I had the opportunity to live in a beautiful, tropical spanish-speaking country. I have lived in Colorado and currently reside in Salt Lake City, Utah. My most recent employer is PBS Utah, which is located at the University of Utah's Eccles Broadcast Center. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Although I have no experience in web developing, I am very much looking forward to overcoming the challenges that come with learning these brand new skills. I am excited and eager to incorporate these learned skills as time goes on in the hopes of beginning a fulfilling career in coding. After all, in the words of the great Michael Scott, "People will never be replaced by machines. In the end, life and business are about human connections. And computers are about trying to murder you in a lake. And to me the choice is easy."
